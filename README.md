- Stray light analysis and telescope baffle design
- PST, PSNIT, and OAR
- Ghost image analysis
- Simulation of spectrometers and other multi-spectral systems
- Polarization effects, including birefringence
- Thermal loading
- Narcissus effects
- Diffracted stray light

TracePro 7.0 can handle complex geometries, materials, sources, detectors, and coatings. It can import and export CAD files from various formats, such as SolidWorks, IGES, STEP, STL, and DXF. It can also interface with other optical design software, such as OSLO, Zemax, and Code V.
     
## What are the benefits of TracePro 7.0?
     
TracePro 7.0 offers many benefits over previous versions and other optical design software, such as:

- Increased raytracing speed up to 10 times over the 6.0 version using new multi-threading algorithms. This means you can get faster and more accurate results for your simulations.
- New interactive optimizer specifically designed for non-sequential design on LED and illumination systems. This feature allows you to quickly sketch your design, verify it with interactive raytrace, and optimize it with target specifications.
- Rearrangeable system tree to create assemblies and standard drag and drop operations to arrange parts and assemblies. This feature gives you more flexibility and control over your system structure and organization.
- New RepTile geometries, a flattened and pointed cone for the backlight display simulation. These geometries enable you to model complex light guides and diffusers with high efficiency and accuracy.
- New irradiance options, including a new rainbow palette and normalization for stray light point source transmittance calculations. These options allow you to visualize your irradiance maps with more clarity and detail.
